## Introduction

In the realm of finance, accurate modelling of interest rates and discount factors is crucial for effective investment strategies and risk management. This project focuses on the estimation of discount factors and interest rate yield curves for sovereign and corporate bonds in the Eurozone, leveraging daily data from 2010 to 2023.

Utilizing a comprehensive dataset that includes bond prices, days to maturity, coupon payments, and credit default swaps (CDS), this analysis employs spline regression to generate precise yield curves for individual countries and the Eurozone as a whole. The outcomes of this project aim to enhance the understanding of interest rate dynamics within the Euro area, providing valuable insights for investors and policymakers alike.
